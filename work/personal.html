		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<p>I began working on the latest iteration of my personal website in 2015, when I laid out my current brand identity and put the homepage together.</p>
		<p>It took me a while to get to filling in all the content, but here we are, finally.</p>

		<h2>The Batter's Eye</h2>
		<p>My first foray into video game design and development saw me wrangling CAD software and Unity on top of my usual app design workflow to create a turn-based double-blind Battleship-like representation of the mental duel between pitcher and batter.</p>
		<p>I hope to come back to this concept one day.</p>
