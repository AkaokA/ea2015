description: I take pride in my hobbies, and embrace the technical and multidisciplinary challenge of one-off personal creative projects.</p><p>I strongly believe in the transferability of experience that can be gained by gently expanding one's boundaries—building on top of skills and perspectives that were learned before, often in very different contexts.</p><p>These are some of the side projects I'm most proud of.

		<h2>Dynamic Drum Lighting</h2>
		<p>Over the COVID-19 lockdowns, like many others did, I dove into a new hobby that ended up becoming a major passion—in my case, drumming.</p>
		<p>Getting an electric drum kit presented a fun opportunity to keep up my electronics and programming chops by building a MIDI-controlled lighting display using an Arduino and a multi-colour LED light strip.</p>

		<h2>The Batter's Eye</h2>
		<p>My first foray into video game design and development saw me wrangling CAD software and Unity—on top of my usual app design workflow—to create a turn-based double-blind Battleship-like representation of the mental duel between pitcher and batter.</p>
		<p>I hope to come back to this concept one day.</p>

		<h2>Netrunner Click/Credit Counter</h2>
		<p>My favourite, most multi-discipline project to date, this is a device I designed and built for use with <em>Android: Netrunner</em>, one of my favourite card games.</p>
		<p>I honed my soldering skills, learned to program an Arduino, designed the enclosure using parametric CAD software, and used a laser cutter for the first time.</p>

		<h2>Weather & Transit Dashboard</h2>
		<p>I have an old first-generation iPad that had been collecting dust; I decided to repurpose it as a dashboard fixture for my apartment.</p>
		<p>The iPad now sits on my kitchen shelf, displaying the weather forecast along with ETAs for the next vehicles to arrive at the nearest bus stop.</p>
		<p>This dashboard was built as a static website which consumes the Dark Sky and NextBus APIs.</p>

		<h2>Kaado</h2>
		<p>This is the beginning of an attempt to create a card-game UI framework for the web.</p>
		<p>Using jQuery UI and custom CSS styles and transitions, I hope to capture most of the types of card interactions a game might need, in an effective and delightful manner.</p>

		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<p>I began working on the latest iteration of my personal website in 2015, when I laid out my current brand identity and put the homepage together.</p>
		<p>Hand-written using a rudimentary templating engine on a foundation of HTML, (s)CSS, and plain Javascript from the beginning—it stands as an example of simple tools and standards affording clean, accessible experiences on the web.</p>
