title: BumpTop
years: 2009 â€“ 2010
description: BumpTop was an innovative desktop replacement utility that sought to bring physicality and fun to the desktop UI. Icons had weight, and the three-dimensional freeform space afforded a more organic way of organizing your files.</p><p>I was involved as a contractor, designing icons and UI for the Mac version of the product, as well as its marketing website.
