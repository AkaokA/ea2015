		<h2>Pano for iOS</h2>
		<p>My work on Pano paved the way for the rest of my career as a mobile app designer.</p>
		<p>We at Debacle, along with the rest of the industry, learned all of our lessons out in the field.</p>

		<h2>Pano for Android</h2>
		<p>As a natural followup to our initial success, we ported <em>Pano</em> to Android.</p>

		<h2>Pano for Windows Phone</h2>
		<p>As sales of Pano continued, we were approached by Microsoft and Nokia to develop a version of Pano for their new Windows Phone 7 mobile OS.</p>
		<p>Our goal for this port was to keep all the functionality of Pano while staying in line with WP7's then-radical Metro design language.</p>

		<h2>Self Image</h2>
		<p>Mobile phone cameras around this time had lacklustre cameras, especially the front-facing camera.</p>
		<p>In order to use the higher-quality rear camera for selfies, we used computer vision technology to create an app that would automatically take a photo when a face was detected in the frame.</p>
