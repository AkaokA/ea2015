title: The Game Band
years: 2022 – 2023
description: The Game Band is a small independent video game studio that made waves with <em>Blaseball</em>, a live, community-driven, fantasy sports experience with an emergent absurdist horror narrative.</p><p>Development on <em>Blaseball</em> ceased in 2023—prior to that, I was tasked with applying an all-new design language to the game, and collaborating with game designers to create UI for new gameplay features.

		<h2><em>Blaseball</em> Web Redesign</h2>
		<p><em>Blaseball</em> was unusual in the video game landscape as its primarily text-based sports-betting-adjacent format lent itself to a more app-like presentation than most indie games on the market.</p>
		<p>Upon joining the team, I began overhauling the visual style and interaction design of the product, applying much of its quirky, dark vibe to a comprehensive and modernized visual style—along with a screen-by-screen redesign of the game: from information architecture and navigation, to accessible colours, iconography, and text styles.</p>

		<h2><em>Blaseball</em> Mobile Redesign</h2>
		<p><em>Blaseball</em> had previously been a desktop-web-only product, and part of the mandate of the 2023 relaunch was to target mobile as a primary platform.</p>
		<p>As with the web product, I used the all-new design language and reusable components to create a data-rich experience that could still be played comfortably on the go.</p>
