description: One of Canada's leaders in financial tech, Wealthsimple offers personal finance and trading products for millions of Canadians.</p><p>Over my 5 years on Wealthsimple's world-class UX team, I played a major role in their <em>Invest</em> and <em>Trade</em> products, as well as creating, maintaining, and evangelizing Wealthsimple's Design System (aka <em>Patchwork</em>) through major product shifts—all while upholding the values of simplicity and trust that are core to the company's mission.

		<h2>Unification</h2>
		<p>One of Wealthsimple's most impactful projects during my time there was <em>Unification</em>: a company-wide initiative to bring our then-separate Invest, Trade, Crypto, Save, and Cash products into a single app.</p>
		<p>Working closely with stakeholders including the CPO, VP of Product, and Director of Design, I helped define the information architecture and overall user experience for the Unified App, leveraging and updating <em>Patchwork</em> to create the framework for a product that aligned with business goals and client needs.</p>

		<h2><em>Unification</em> UI Art Direction</h2>
		<p>The Unification project coincided with a minor brand refresh led by the Brand & Marketing team, which gave us a great starting point for a UI visual style overhaul, which I oversaw.</p>
		<p>Over the course of a few weeks, I gathered a group of designers and conducted a series of workshops intended to hone in on an aesthetic that honoured our brand's values. </p>
		<p>I developed a series of design exercises that encouraged my colleagues to design beyond their usual constraints, and then facilitated discussions on what it means for a product to engage with its brand values.</p>

		<h2><em>Patchwork</em> Accessible UI Colour System</h2>
		<p>One of the most defining elements of any brand representation is its colour palette—the Brand team's refresh brought with it a number of soothing, friendly tones meant to inspire confidence and calm in a time of great uncertainty.</p>
		<p>Tasked with bringing these tones to our new Unified product while satisfying our accessibility requirements, I researched colour space theory and perceptual colour spaces, and wrote my own palette-generating applet in React—this allowed me to create perceptual lightness gradients for arbitrary colours, ensuring that for any given seed colour, a set of WCAG-compliant shades could be easily selected for use in product UI.</p>

		<h2><em>Patchwork</em> Component Library</h2>
		<p>In my first few months at Wealthsimple, I began working on and maintaining a component library for my and the UX team's convenience. Over the years, its utility proved more and more valuable as the company grew, and in cooperation with engineering, it became a critical resource, ensuring that every new product and feature was built on top of a solid, consistent foundation that was easy to implement.</p>
		<p>I was the de facto steward of Patchwork through my time at the company, and to this day it remains a key part of how Wealthsimple builds its products.</p>

		<h2>Interaction Design Details</h2>
		<p>While not often explicitly mandated by the product team, one of my favourite pastimes—especially early on while the team was smaller—was to sneak in little moments of user-facing delight into our apps. </p>
		<p>One of these that I'm most proud of was the "Coinpile": when a user successfully makes a deposit, the success screen shows Wealthsimple-branded gold coins rain down in an extravagant display. On top of that, it hid another moment of delight when users realize that the pile of coins reacted to accelerometer inputs, allowing the user to shake and jostle them in their hand.</p>
		<p>I built this UX myself using Apple's SceneKit 3D engine, and convinced an engineer to integrate it into the shipping Invest app, where it remained until Unification.</p>
